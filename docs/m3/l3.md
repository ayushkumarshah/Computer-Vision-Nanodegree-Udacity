# Kalman Filters

- very popular technique for estimating the state of a system. Similar to the
    probabilistic localization method (Monte Carlo localization in lesson 2)

- difference in these tracking algorithms: 


|Kalman Filters|Monte Carlo Localization|
|---|---|
|estimating Continuous state| Discrete states|
|uni modal distributions| Multi-modal distributions|
|Approximate Gaussian Distribution| Estimate Histogram|

- A Kalman filter gives us a mathematical way to infer velocity from only a set of measured locations.
- Gaussian with smallest variance preferred (since ot has minimum uncertainty)

- 2 cycles:
  - Measurement Update - Bayes Rule (Product)
  - Prediction - Total Probability (Convolution)
  -

- WHen we combine 2 Gaussians, (prior and event) then the resulting Gaussian has
    higher peak i.e. smaller variance which means more certainty since
    information content is higher.
